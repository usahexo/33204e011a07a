<h2 id="Borscht"><a href="#Borscht" class="headerlink" title="Borscht"></a>Borscht</h2><p>Borscht is a soup that typically contains beetroot, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, meat or bone stock, and sour cream. It is of Ukrainian origin and is one of the most popular dishes in Russian cuisine. Evidence suggests that borscht was first made in the Ukraine during the 12th century. The exact origins are unknown, but it is thought to have been based on a Mongolian soup. Borscht was served to royalty and was eventually introduced to the Russian tsars. Today, it is still a popular dish in Russia and other countries in Eastern Europe.</p>
<h2 id="Chili-con-carne"><a href="#Chili-con-carne" class="headerlink" title="Chili con carne"></a>Chili con carne</h2><p>Chili con carne is a spicy stew or chili made with beef and chili peppers. The dish originated in Texas and is popular throughout the United States. Chili con carne has been attributed to several different people over the years, but the most likely creator was cowboys who worked in the chili business in San Antonio, Texas in the early 19th century. The dish was likely invented as a way to make use of leftover beef and chili peppers. Chili con carne eventually spread throughout Texas and became popular among both ranchers and townspeople. It was also introduced to soldiers during World War II, which helped contribute to its widespread popularity.</p>
<h2 id="Chicken-tikka-masala"><a href="#Chicken-tikka-masala" class="headerlink" title="Chicken tikka masala"></a>Chicken tikka masala</h2><p>Chicken tikka masala is a creamy Indian dish made with roasted chicken cubes cooked in a spiced tomato sauce. The dish is often served with naan bread or rice. Chicken tikka masala has become one of Britain’s most popular dishes and has even been given the title of “national dish” of England. There are many different theories about how this dish originated, but the most likely explanation is that it was created by accident by an Indian chef working in Glasgow, Scotland during the 1970s. The chef reportedly combined spices used in Indian cooking with leftover chicken tikka (a common Indian dish) and tomato sauce to create a new dish which he then served to his customers. The dish became popular and soon spread throughout Great Britain.</p>
